This repository includes modifications to build Matthew Millman's modified rotary-to-dtmf firmware using Arduino IDE.

Arduino as ISP to upload the firmware to attiny85/atmega88/atmega8.
Later I will add tutorials for the development environment.

# Hardware construction
attiny85 with 8Mhz crystal.
